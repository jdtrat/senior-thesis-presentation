# Hello, World.

???

Hi! So my name is Jonathan Trattner. I am graduate with a Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Computational Neuroscience. This was an interdisciplinary major and I was able to work with Dr. Lucy D'Agostino McGowan from the Department of Statistics on some really cool applied projects.

The one I'm going to be talking about today is a tool we developed for what's called behavioral data collection in neuroscience-land and surveys or questionnaires everywhere else. Without further ado, I'm just going to jump right into it.

First and foremost, R is free unlike some other statistical softwares used in academia like SPSS or Stata.

???

Secondly, it's easily extendible and open source. So, as we will see, anyone can develop a package with code that is easily usable by others.

* It has a vibrant community of use.r-color.b[R]s
]

???

Thirdly, it has a vibrant community of users and developers all of whom are super nice. There's a lot of discussion with people of all skill-levels about how to make R the best for the most people.

Another benefit, not on the slide because I'm going to get into it more, is R's easy integration with other programming languages. So, R itself is derived from the language S, but its creators Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman took lots of inspiration from Scheme. A lot of R is actually written in C and C++ to optimize performance, and there a many packages that help users integrate these languages. 

What I'm going to focus on today is R's integration with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Why is this important? Well Shiny is used in academia and industry for a whole host of, well, everything. A lot of data analysis pipelines are built with R, where you can connect to a data base, train and run some model, and analyze and visualize your results.

My neuroscience research lab, for example, has used surveys in the past to correlate behaviors such as political ideology with nueroimaging data. Within the medical field, there are many epidemiological questionnaires, such as did you get your Covid-19 vaccine?

- Existing survey tools don't always integrate well with data analysis pipelines
]


???

So the ability to easily collect and analyze data is important. Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, Qualtrics, all exist for this purpose, but they often don't integrate with existing data analysis or research pipelines. 

As I mentioned, R has become an extremely popular language and so, with the help of Dr. McGowan, we designed {shinysurveys} to streamline this data collection and analysis process.

Well, those of you who were here for Nuri's talk a few minutes ago, might recall the use of a survey module to collect demographic information. That was actually done using {shinysurveys}. 

There's a huge number of applications for our package, and today I'm just going to highlight some of the key design features of it, technical challenges, and next steps.

Recalling the basic structure of a shiny application, the user-interface and the server, our package provides two functions. One for each component.

)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
   renderSurvey(df = questions, 
              theme = "#63B8FF")

In the ui component, you call surveyOutput, which takes in a data frame of questions, and an optional title or description.

In multiple choice questions, for example, this would be the possible answers. For questions without discrete answers, such as a numeric input, this would be the default option shown on the input. For text inputs, like this one, it is the placeholder value. We can also have it as an NA, meaning no value, and the package will automatically add a placeholder of quote-on-quote "Placeholder."

We've seen that you can create surveys with a flat file like a csv or excel spreadsheet that can easily be read into R. But what does that look like? Well, consider the question "What is your favorite food?" and let's add another question "What's your name?"

```{r, echo = FALSE}

data.frame(question = c("What is your favorite food?",

???

So this is great. We have a data frame, i.e. a table, that can be saved and shared as a csv or excel spreadsheet, and that's what we can use to define our survey.

So here is just a screenshot of the csv file that I opened in Excel and it contains our two questions. As I mentioned, one of the benefits of our package is that you can easily share these files and read them into R to create a survey.

So, if one wanted to create a survey asking about favorite foods and names, like we see here, we could do so with this csv.

Today I briefly covered one of the packages I've worked on this year with Dr. McGowan. shinysurveys was designed to help bridge the gap between data collection and data processing that is not as well supported with other options such as Google Forms or Qualtrics.

As you've seen here today, shinysurveys is straightforward to implement. There are some advanced features such as URL-based user tracking and dependency questions that I did not cover, but are fully documented online, which leads to my last point that it is fully open source!

shinysurveys is open-source so anyone can look at the code, suggest changes, or modify it themselves for internal purposes. 

In the future, we hope to make it even easier for people to deploy our surveys and are working on developing a GUI, a graphical user interface, similar to Google Forms or Qualtrics that will allow you to simply define your questions and download the R code needed to deploy the code.

And just to really wrap it up, I'd like to point anyone interested in this work, or some of the other packages I worked on for my thesis, towards my thesis website, senior-thesis.jdtrat.com.

I go more in-depth into shinysurveys there, as well as provide a more robust background on R and the other packages I worked on. And, most importantly, I thank all of the people who helped shape my academic trajectory. Some of those people are here today, and that leads me to my next slide. There are three people who I'm especially grateful to who helped me hone my R skills and directly led to this thesis project.

Dr. Lucy McGowan: She is my thesis advisor through the stats department and helped foster my interest in R and programming in general. 

I learned so much about statistics and R through her statistical learning course, even more as her TA, and still more from working with her. She's been such a huge help and I owe her so much for my current trajectory post-college. So thank you, Dr. McGowan.

Dr. Ken Kishida: He is a professor in the Department of Neuroscience at Wake Forest School of Medicine and I've been doing research with him for the past three plus years. In about a week, I'll be joining his lab full time to pursue a master's, and he's just been super supportive of my endeavors and provided me the space to combine my interests with R, programming, and neuroscience, and I'm excited to see what we come up with over the next year.

Dr. Mason Garrison: She is a professor of quantitative psychology and I met her randomly right before I went abroad my junior fall, and when I came back we got to chatting about our mutual interests in R, and she took me into her lab and we've produced some really cool R packages. She's really fun to work with and super supportive of my ventures, and yeah. Thank you so much.

And, as I mentioned for a full-list of people who have contributed to my educational maturation, please check out my written thesis at senior-thesis.jdtrat.com. And, now I'll take some questions!
